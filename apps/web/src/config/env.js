/**
 * Every environment value the web app reads, in one place.
 *
 * This module has two consumers with different notions of "environment":
 * the browser bundle, where Vite has replaced `import.meta.env` with the
 * `VITE_`-prefixed values it baked in at build time, and Node, where
 * `scripts/generateSeoPages.js` prerenders pages using the same Supabase
 * queries. So both are consulted, Vite first.
 *
 * Nothing is defaulted. The old hardcoded project reference meant a staging
 * deploy that forgot its variables would quietly read and write production — the
 * one failure worth being loud about, since it puts sandbox purchases and test
 * data in real customers' accounts.
 *
 * Reads are deferred rather than captured at import, so a Node script can populate
 * `process.env` in its own body and still be seen.
 *
 * See docs/ENVIRONMENTS.md.
