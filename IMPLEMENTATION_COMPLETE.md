## Next Steps for User

### 1. Set Up Supabase (Required)

Follow the comprehensive guide in `DISCORD_AUTH_SETUP.md`:

1. Create Discord OAuth app
2. Create Supabase project
3. Configure Discord provider in Supabase
4. Run database setup SQL
5. Configure environment variables

**Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create `.env` file in project root:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

### 3. Test Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Test the following:
- [ ] Sign in with Discord works
- [ ] User profile appears in header
- [ ] Save trade functionality
- [ ] Load trade from history
- [ ] Delete trade from history
- [ ] Search trades by name
- [ ] Sign out works
- [ ] Buttons are disabled when not logged in

### 4. Deploy

The app is ready for deployment once Supabase is configured. Update environment variables in your deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.).

## Feature Highlights

### Smart UI/UX
- Buttons automatically disable when user is not authenticated
- Helpful tooltips explain why features are disabled
- Success toasts provide feedback for actions
- Loading states during async operations
- Error messages are user-friendly

### Responsive Design
- Works in landscape and portrait modes
- Mobile-friendly layouts
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Adaptive spacing and typography

### Performance
- Authentication state cached in localStorage
- Trades fetched on-demand
- Optimistic UI updates
- Minimal re-renders with React context

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Supabase?
- Built-in OAuth providers (including Discord)
- Row Level Security for data isolation
- Real-time capabilities (for future features)
- Generous free tier
- Automatic token management

### Why React Context?
- Simple global auth state
- No Redux complexity needed
- Native React solution
- Easy to test and mock

### Data Storage
- Trades stored as JSONB for flexibility
- Can query and index JSON fields
- Easy to add new fields without migrations
- Maintains compatibility with existing URL encoding

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Authentication
- [ ] Sign in redirects to Discord correctly
- [ ] After auth, returns to app with session
- [ ] User info displays in header
- [ ] Sign out clears session and UI updates

### Automated Testing (Future)
- Mock Supabase client in tests
- Test AuthContext provider
- Test save/load functions

## Known Limitations

1. **Offline Support:** Requires internet for auth and history
2. **Price Updates:** Saved trades don't auto-update prices
3. **Bulk Operations:** No bulk delete or export yet
4. **Search:** Name-only search (no advanced filters)
