## Features Implemented

### Trade History Page

- **Navigation**: Accessible via hamburger menu or LoginButton dropdown
- **Search**: Filter trades by name
- **Load Trade**: Click load icon to navigate back to home with trade loaded
- **Edit Trade**: Click edit icon to rename a trade (opens dialog)
- **Delete Trade**: Click delete icon with confirmation prompt
- **Authentication**: Redirects to home if not signed in
- **Empty State**: Helpful message when no trades exist
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

### User Flow

1. **Access History**:
   - Click hamburger menu → "Trade History", OR
   - Click user avatar → "View History"
   
2. **Edit Trade Name**:
   - Navigate to Trade History page
   - Click edit icon on any trade
   - Enter new name in dialog
   - Click Save

3. **Load Trade**:
   - Navigate to Trade History page
   - Click load icon on any trade
   - Automatically navigated back to home
   - Trade loads into calculator

4. **Delete Trade**:
   - Navigate to Trade History page
   - Click delete icon on any trade
   - Confirm deletion
   - Trade removed from list

## Technical Details

### Navigation State

- Trade data is passed via React Router's location state
- When loading a trade, user is navigated to home with `{ state: { loadTrade: trade } }`
- Home page watches for this state and loads the trade automatically
- State is cleared after loading to prevent reloading on refresh

### Edit Functionality

- Uses existing `updateTrade` service function
- Only allows editing the trade name (not cards)
- Updates are reflected immediately in the UI
- Errors are displayed via alert

### Authentication Integration

- Trade History page checks for authenticated user
- Shows sign-in prompt if not authenticated
- "Back to Home" button for easy navigation
- Same authentication requirements as before

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Better UX**: Full-page view allows more space for trade details
2. **Easier Navigation**: Integrated into main navigation flow
3. **Cleaner Code**: Removes modal complexity
4. **More Features**: Room for future enhancements (sorting, filtering, pagination)
5. **Consistent**: Follows standard web app patterns
